# todo-list-app
Todo list app to help users organize their projects and tasks

Designed using Figma. Created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Uses the Web Storage API. From this project, I learned how to:
- Keep track of data between different JavaScript files
- Dynamically create new elements and keep track of their respective data values
- Create factory functions, objects, and static properties to provide information to one another
- Use the localStorage API to save the user's inputs on their computer
- Use React components, React hooks, and props to structure and manipulate the DOM
