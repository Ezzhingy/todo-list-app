# todo-list-app
Todo list app to help users organize their projects and tasks

Designed using Figma. Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Compiled using npm and webpack. Uses the Web Storage API. From this project, I learned how to:
- Keep track of data between different JavaScript files
- Dynamically create new elements and keep track of their respective data values
- Create factory functions and objects to provide information to one another
- Use the localStorage API to save the user's inputs on their computer
